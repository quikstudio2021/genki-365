                <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
                <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Genki 365 mobile application (the "App").</p>

                <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
                <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

                <h3>2. Use of the App</h3>

                <h3>3. Subscriptions</h3>
                <p>Some features require a subscription (monthly or yearly). Subscriptions are billed through Apple's App Store and are subject to the App Store's Terms and Conditions. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the current period ends. <b>Any billing inquiries, refunds, or cancellations must be handled directly through Apple's App Store.</b></p>

                <h3>4. Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Genki 365 and its licensors.</p>

                <h3>5. Termination</h3>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. You may cease using the App and terminate your account at any time. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

                <h3>6. Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>The App is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.</p>

                <h3>7. Third-Party Links and Services</h3>
                <p>The App may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Genki 365. We assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services. Your interactions with any third-party ad networks or content providers are solely between you and those third parties.</p>

                <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>In no event shall Genki 365 be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App.</p>

                <h3>9. Updates to Terms</h3>
                <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Updates will be reflected in the app, and continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

                <h3>10. Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Genki 365 operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
